# Apartment Price Web Scraping

Hello! This project is my attempt to collect apartment data from Equity Residential apartments and analyze price fluctuations. This project relies on a webscraper that runs daily to collect ~3,700 apartment listings. The data is then cleaned and fed into a model that can determine when is a good time to sign a lease.  


# How It Works

Equity Residential has 284 apartment complexes across the United States and every apartment listing follows a standard-ish format. This webscraper collects all the important info from every listing, such as Price, Beds, Baths, etc.
